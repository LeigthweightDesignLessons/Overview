# Fighting

Fights in Sytasia are based on a turn based combat system.

# 0. Pre-Turn
- determines the player order (sort by Init values)
- determines action points (3xInitative + 3)

# 1. Turn-Phase
- in pre defined order every character can deciede to spend form zero to all available action points
- when ever the current player wants, he can delay his attack by sorting himself somewhere behind his current position

## Multiple Actions

Doing the multiple things at the same time requires not more actionspoints but will icreased check difficulty significantly.

## Attack and Defense


### Attack
If a player decides on a attack he has to describe how he wants to attack as detailed as he can.
The gamemaster than deciede, how the amount of extra accuracy, charging time and extra power will be go into additional checks or extra actionpoints costs.

??? "Example"
    A Player, lets call him "Pete" for now, wants to make a bg attack with his Zombie Warrior "Wilhelm" on a group of Lava-Spiders.
    Tim describes his attack as following:
    "Wilhelm, pumps his blood into his right arm till it swalls up two times its original size.
    Wilhem during this, he swings the right arm around and tries to smashes his fist into the center of the spider group."
    
    The Gamemaster tells Pete that because of the additional time needed to pump up the arm, this attack will cost 2 actionpoints instead of one. The gamemaster further whats to see two see a succesfull body transformation check, two strength checks, to lift and accelerate the arm, and at least one succesfull dexterity check, to aim with this deadly combination.

    Pete now has two options:

    If Pete deciedes to roll on the required checks three things can happen:
    1. Pete fails all checks 
    2. Pete fails at least one and succeeds in at least one.
    3. Pete succeeds in all checks.
    If Pete fails all checks his character "Wilhelm" will suffer a critical fail. For example Wilhelm cant over pump the blood, venes rupture and the because of the imense forces his arm falls of and gets thrown in the distance.
    If Pete succeeds in at least one, but also fails in at least one check. Whilhelms attack will have no to little impact. For example, Pete succeeds in all test execept the dexterity check. This results in Wilhelm throwing his arm far of center. Meaning that only a third of all spiders gets attacked.
    In the last case when all checks are successfull, Wilhelm successfully landed his immense attack, meaning that the gamemaster will evaluate his damage as a level 4 attack.

because this decribes how many actionspoints and what kind of checks the gamemaster will request from the player.



### Defense
If the attack check succeed, the attacked player can decieds how he will response. 
Like an attack, each defensive action also requires actionspoints.
Defening actions can be catagorized into the following catagories:
- nothing
- evade
- block
- counter attack
Describing your defense in detail is crutial!
The description determines the amount and kind of checks, actionspoints and the resulting consequences if the defense succeed.

??? "Determine if a successfull defensive action is enough"
    An Assasin attacs the monk, be throw his poissiones dagger.
    Instead of a normal throwing attack the assassin decides on a more precies bumerang throw.
    He then makes a 3xDex check and succeeds.
    The monk whants to evade but, to completely evade the damage he has to make at least a C3 worthy defensive roll. 
    The monk, knowing his capabilities, dont think that he can put this of, but deciedes to instead of risking getting the full damage and eventually get parallies if the poision gets into his heart, he rotate his body just enough so the dagger faces his arm protections.
    The game master, decides that this requires a 2xDex chec, which the monk is able to pass.


### Damage


??? "Example"
    A warrior wants to roll behind the enemy and makes a strong hit with his sword. 

If the player 

Defending other players requires a init check


# 2. End-Phase
- if no character has available action points
- **or** no action was done in this turn
a new turn is started by
