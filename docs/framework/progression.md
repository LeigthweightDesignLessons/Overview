At the beginn of the character creation the player can spend 20 Attribute- and 40 Skillpoints.
The player can spend more then the initial startpoints but then also have to give his character negative perks.
A player cant spend over 9, 14 and 19 points without having to archive in a challenge.

At the beginning if a player decides to spend over 9 points in a particular Skill or Attribute, the player do not necessary have to complete a challenge, but have to explain it with his character story.

During a level up, the player gets 2 free Attributepoint and 4 free Skillpoints.

Level 20 is normaly archived at the middle of a bigger campain.

## Challenges
Challenges are based checks with an estimated success chance below 25%.
If the player succeeds the challenges he gains +1 in the used value and if reaches a value of 10, 15 or 20 he gains a related perk.

The gamemaster have the right to refuse the challenge reward if he thinks that the player tries to exploit the challenge system.

Challenges are also the only way to develop the character stats after reaching the maximum level.
