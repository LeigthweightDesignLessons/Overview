# Stats and Values

In *Syntasia* a value between 0 (complete noob) and 20 (legendary) is used to represent how good your character is in a particular thing.
These "things" are divided into two catagories:

1. [Attributes](#Attributes)
2. [Skills](#Skills)

A higher stat value is good because a check is passed if a roll with 20 sited dices (D20) is below the according stat value.
Attributes and Skills can be increased threw the progression system, but a character cant get the level 10, 15 and 20 if he does not show himself worthy by passing a challenge. 
Passing the level challanges grants the player one unique trait which fits its playstyle.
In Addition, level 20 grants the special effect, that rolls smaller or equal 5 grants an extra success.
